This repository contains Python notebooks implementing several simple Convolutional Neural Networks for image 
lassification on the Cifar10 dataset. The goal of this project was to explore overfitting in CNNs, and study
the effect that data augmentation and regularization methods would have on CNN performance in image
classification tasks.

Full details can be found in the final report PDF.
